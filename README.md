# CPSC233_Project
To compile the source code from the command line you need to compile the source code from outside the package. In this case the command would be javac packageName/*.java when you are in the same directory/folder as the package. This compiles any file with the “.java” extension in the folder/package  all the java classes). Then to run the code, type java packageName /Test. This source code can also be run in eclipse.

To run the program, enter number values in each text box. For the air conditioner internal rate of change the number must be negative as the air conditioner decreases the temperature. For all other internal rates of change the number must be positive as they all increase the value. 

To start the simulation, click the “Run” button. To stop the program click the “Stop” button. To save and stop the program click the “Save” button. To load the previously saved simulation, click the “Load” button. Note that the “Run” button can only be clicked once and that you must either run the program first or load and run a saved program first. (You cannot save first.)
